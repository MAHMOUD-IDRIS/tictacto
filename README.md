# TictactoGame
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this game.
The game Idea is to match three identical images in the same line. The line could be horizontal, virtical or diagonal.
I have made it more "interesting" hopefully by adding more options to the conventional two symbols, here you have more than two photos to match.
## How To Play:
* Open HTML file with a web browser. 
* Click on the cover to reveal the image underneath. (there is always another image underneath each image)
* keep clicking until you get a match.
## Game rules.
* All images are legible for winning except the cover image.
* If you click on the photo of my nephew he will get you 5 more moves bonus :) 
* beware of burguer images because they will stick once they appear and if you stick 4 of them you lose.
* you can always start over afresh.
